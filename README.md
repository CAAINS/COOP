# ```$COOP``` : A social token brings us together

## What is ```$coop?```
```$COOP``` 是一個建立在Nervos公鏈上的社區合作幣，使得社區交換時間與勞力更為容易與自主。在技術結構設計上，每個領到空投的帳戶（准社員）都內涵足夠的CKB, 可以為兩個朋友新增 ```$COOP``` 帳戶，所有```$COOP```帳戶間的轉帳是免費的（空投帳戶內有足夠10000次的交易費用），這使得社群成員間的交易互惠無任何門檻。

``$COOP`` is a community cooperative coin built on the Nervos public chain, making it easier and more autonomous for the community to exchange time and labor. The technical structure is designed in such a way that each airdroped account (associate member) contains enough CKB to add ``$COOP`` accounts for two friends, and all transfers between ```$COOP``` accounts are free of charge (there are enough fees for 10,000 transactions), making there no threshold for reciprocal transactions in community.
